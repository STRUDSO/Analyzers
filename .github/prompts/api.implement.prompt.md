Now we have a plan we are ready to implement the use-case.

You are not forced to follow the plan if you gain insights that will help you during the implementation - just make sure to document these in docs/features/api/{Use-case}/{Use-case}-log.md and docs/features/api/{Use-case}/{Use-case}-insights-gained.md

Make sure you read you implementation plan as described in docs/features/api/{Use-case}/{Use-case}-plan.md

Please make a log of you changes in docs/features/api/{Use-case}/{Use-case}-log.md during your implementation.

If you gain insight during the implementation please write these into docs/features/api/{Use-case}/{Use-case}-insights-gained.md
