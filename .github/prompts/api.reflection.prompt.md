# API Reflection Prompt

Now that you have implemented the feature compare your first plan in docs/features/api/{Use-case}/{Use-case}-plan.md with your implementation and new knowledge.
Revisit all the files you made to make sure you remember everything you did.

Use git log to see what you did or `git diff --name-only` to get a list of changed files.

Then create a new document docs/features/api/{Use-case}/{Use-case}-afterimplementation.md and document your step-by-step plan with your new knowledge.
Take your time - think deeply until you fully understand and have the most optimal plan.

When you have completed the after implementation document, please follow these steps:

Read docs/consolidated_learnings.md and update it with your new knowledge documented in docs/features/api/{Use-case}/{Use-case}-afterimplementation.md

- Prioritize High-Value Insights: Focus on lessons that significantly impact future performance, lead to more robust or generalizable understanding, or detail critical errors and their resolutions, major time-saving discoveries, fundamental shifts in understanding, and essential project-specific configurations.
- Be Concise & Actionable: Information should be clear, to the point, and useful when revisited. What can be done differently or leveraged next time?
- Strive for Clarity and Future Usability: Document insights in a way that is clear and easily understandable for future review, facilitating effective knowledge retrieval and application (akin to self-explainability).
- Organize for Retrieval: Structure consolidated_learnings.md logically. Use clear headings and Markdown formatting.
- Avoid Low-Utility Information in consolidated_learnings.md: This file should not contain trivial statements.
- Support Continuous Improvement: The ultimate goal is to avoid repeating mistakes, accelerate future tasks, and make you more robust and reliable. Frame all knowledge with this in mind.
- Manage Information Density: Actively work to keep consolidated_learnings.md dense with high-value information and free of outdated or overly verbose content.
